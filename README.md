# Work in progress

Code in Python3

This is for learning purpose only, in purpose of extracting and manipulate the data, then extracting the data out to a csv type file.

LOS 1 is to be able to create a simple function:
  To use BeautifulSoup4 to extract the desired information from a website
  To create a dictionary from that data, and to be able to manipulate the string
  To create a new csv file(if not existed yet), and append into that file a new line with the info.
  
LOS2 is to create a list of website:
  Use the function to pull the data from a multiple site.
  
In progress:
  To present the data in a organized way
  To analyse the extracted data
  Reorganise the code, make it more efficient and less time consuming
  Apply it to the next learning project.
